{"name": "Firefly 2","tagline": "A new, clean, component-based version of FireflyGL, the C#/OpenGL 2D rendering and game engine.","body":"### Example usage\r\nHere's a quick example you can paste in your Program.Main that will display a colored square on your screen.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n\tvar stage = new Stage(800, 500, \"Hello World\");\r\n\r\n\tstage.TreeNode.AddChild(new Entity\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tnew GeometryComponent\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tnew Vector2d(0, 0),\r\n\t\t\tnew Vector2d(100, 0),\r\n\t\t\tnew Vector2d(100, 100),\r\n\t\t\tnew Vector2d(0, 100)\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tnew ShapeColorComponent\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tnew Vector4(1, 0, 0, 1),\r\n\t\t\tnew Vector4(0, 1, 0, 1),\r\n\t\t\tnew Vector4(0, 0, 1, 1),\r\n\t\t\tnew Vector4(1, 1, 0, 1)\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tnew RenderBufferComponent(stage.Renderer),\r\n\t\tnew TreeNodeComponent()\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n\tstage.Run();\r\n```\r\nFirst we make a new Stage instance. The stage is an entity to which you attach other entities that you want on the screen.\r\nTreeNode is a shorthand that points to the stage's TreeNodeComponent. Shorthands will be discussed in the next section.\r\nThe TreeNodeComponent is they way you connect entities together in a hierarchical order.\r\nWe supply the AddChild method with a new entity which we construct on the spot adding some components to it.\r\nThe GeometryComponent provides the mesh coordinate data. It doesn't contain color information or texture coordinates so it can be used for purposes other than rendering.\r\nThe ShapeColorComponent adds the color data to those points.\r\nNext, we add the RenderBufferComponent and the TreeNodeComponent. The render buffer will process the geometry and color data and update the internal buffer that is later rendered.\r\nWe need the tree node so we have an \"attachment point\" for the stage's tree node.\r\n\r\nAfter the setup is done, we call stage.Run. This blocks further code execution until we close the opened window.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Firefly2?
