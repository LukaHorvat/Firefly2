### Example usage
Here's a quick example you can paste in your Program.Main that will display a colored square on your screen.

```csharp
	var stage = new Stage(800, 500, "Hello World");

	stage.TreeNode.AddChild(new Entity
	{
		new GeometryComponent
		{
			new Vector2d(0, 0),
			new Vector2d(100, 0),
			new Vector2d(100, 100),
			new Vector2d(0, 100)
		},
		new ShapeColorComponent
		{
			new Vector4(1, 0, 0, 1),
			new Vector4(0, 1, 0, 1),
			new Vector4(0, 0, 1, 1),
			new Vector4(1, 1, 0, 1)
		},
		new RenderBufferComponent(stage.Renderer),
		new TreeNodeComponent()
	});

	stage.Run();
```
First we make a new Stage instance. The stage is an entity to which you attach other entities that you want on the screen.
